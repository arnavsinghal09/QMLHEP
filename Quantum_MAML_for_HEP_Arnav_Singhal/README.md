# QMAML: Quantum Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning

QMAML combines classical meta-learning (MAML) with parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) to enable rapid adaptation on new tasks with few examples. This project implements and benchmarks QMAML on three datasets: MNIST, Higgs Boson, and Quark–Gluon jets. We analyze the effects of different quantum parameter initializations and demonstrate that QMAML achieves strong performance in complex scientific classification problems.

Validated on:

- **Image classification:** MNIST (few-shot digit recognition)
- **HEP data:** Higgs Boson and Quark–Gluon jet datasets
